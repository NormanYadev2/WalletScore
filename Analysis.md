# ðŸ“Š Wallet Credit Score Analysis


##  Introduction

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the behavioral distribution of blockchain wallets based on credit scores. The credit score is a proxy metric representing user reliability, repayment history, and risk behavior. 

---

**Key Observations:**

- The distribution is **multi-modal**, showing three major peaks:
  - **200â€“300**: The highest concentration of wallets.
  - **500â€“600**: A smaller but significant group of wallets.
  - **700â€“800**: A distinct, high-scoring minority.
  
- Very few wallets exist in the **0â€“100** and **900â€“1000** ranges.

- The KDE curve suggests **three behavioral clusters** based on usage and risk patterns.

## Clustered Behavior Insights

| Score Range | Behavior Summary                              | Risk Level   |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 200â€“300     | Most common wallets. Possibly new or average users with mixed activity and potential risk. | Moderate     |
| 500â€“600     | Active users with decent repayment behavior and fewer liquidations.                      | Low-Moderate |
| 700â€“800     | High-credit wallets, rarely liquidated, consistently repay.                              | Low          |

##  Interpretation

- The majority of wallet users are grouped in the **200â€“300** score range, suggesting a common pattern of behavior, possibly due to minimal activity which reflects risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.
- A secondary cluster at **500â€“600** likely represents more responsible users who show trustworthy patterns.
- The **700â€“800** range includes wallets with excellent behaviorâ€”potentially eligible for higher trust scores or protocol benefits.
- Sparse population in extreme ranges (very low or very high) may indicate **outliers** or **bot-like behavior**.
